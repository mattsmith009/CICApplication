This has raised concerns for the safety of tourists who may be unaware of the risks associated with interacting with wildlife in the area.\n\nAuthorities have advised visitors to the area to keep a safe distance from the seals and to avoid any direct contact with them. Additionally, they have urged tourists to seek immediate medical attention if they were to come into contact with a rabid seal.\n\nThe presence of rabid seals at the tourist hotspot has prompted calls for increased awareness and education about the potential dangers of interacting with wildlife.

Among these diseases, cystic echinococcosis, a zoonotic parasitic infection caused by a group of cestodes, Echinococcus granulosus sensu lato, remains a real human and animal health problem in several regions of the world, including the Mediterranean Basin. Despite the implementation of a number of governmental control programmes using several tools (dog treatment, meat inspection, etc.), this infection is still highly prevalent in North Africa. Here we present a review of the epidemiology of cystic echinococcosis in Tunisia, an analysis of the constraints limiting the effectiveness of the control programmes implemented, and finally argue for the use of the One Health framework to improve the effectiveness of future programmes.\n\nR\u00e9sum\u00e9\n\nL\u2019\u00e9mergence de pand\u00e9mies affectant de mani\u00e8re tr\u00e8s importante la sant\u00e9 humaine a occult\u00e9 les maladies end\u00e9miques qui continuent de repr\u00e9senter un probl\u00e8me de sant\u00e9 animale et humaine dans plusieurs r\u00e9gions du monde.

We are working with the  utmost seriousness and in close partnership with the authorities to  thoroughly investigate and shed light on the circumstances surrounding  this event. Food safety, quality, and the health of our consumers are,  and will always be, at the core of everything we do. We are committed to  providing updates as more information becomes available.''\n\nConsumers who have purchased the recalled products are urged to  follow the instructions provided by the CFIA and refrain from consuming  them.
